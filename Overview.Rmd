# Introduction{-}

This is a postgraduate-level course on academic research methods in language and culture studies, with a particular focus on the areas of language use, learning, and teaching. The course covers a wide variety of issues and topics raised in current and seminal works on language acquisition across ages, in different communities, in and out of the classroom context. It is designed to familiarize the students with a range of qualitative and quantitative research techniques and ethical research practices. The students are also introduced to the core steps of conceptualizing, designing, undertaking, and presenting (orally and in writing) a research project, which are the essential skills for postgraduate students and academics.

The course consists of 1-hour lectures and 2-hour tutorials. The lecture introduces a topic and the topic is then expanded upon and tackled practically in the tutorials. To pass this course, students need to take weekly pre-class quizzes that test the content of the readings and the lecture (50%). In addition, the students will have to submit a project proposal in which they describe a research project. Furthermore, students have to either submit a video of a presentation of the project proposal or present the project proposal in the last tutorial (10%).

# Course Aims{-}

The course aims to introduce research methodology in language and culture studies (with a particular interest in language). It will present the fundamental skills needed to plan and carry out various types of postgraduate research, ranging from critical reading, to structuring course papers and dissertation, to basic practical data collection and analysis tools and techniques. Topics examined include the nature and types of research, research quality and planning, honesty and ethics in research, library and database searches, developing a research topic and literature review, preparing a research proposal, and critical reading and writing skills. Course assessments will provide the opportunity to apply these skills in relevant research tasks.

# Course Changes in Response to Feedback {-}	

Weekly Online Tasks, to be completed in the first half of the semester via Blackboard, start only in week 3 to prevent disadvantages to students who sign up for the course after the orientation period.

The maximum time allotted for completion of each weekly task has been increased from 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.

# Teaching staff{-}

Course Coordinator: [Dr Martin Schweinberger](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/4295/martin-schweinberger) (email: m.schweinberger\@uq.edu.au)

# Office hours{-}

We have a weekly drop-in session that you can attend to ask questions and discuss issues.

# Assumed Background {-}

This course assumes no previous knowledge of research methods, but some knowledge of general and applied linguistics will be useful.

# Course Timetable{-}

There may be minor changes to the learning activities schedule due to, e.g.,  public holidays. Students will be advised of any changes in advance. Dates and times for make-up classes are made available to students in advance via Blackboard.
